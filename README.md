Some Twitter tools using Python and tweepy

I use @Chase06437181 as a hybrid human/code twitter account

# Capabilities
* Follow everyone that follows you
* Like/retweet tweets from a specific keyword or hashtag
* Follow/unfollow everyone that someone else follows
* Like/retweet a user's tweets
* Record the number of followers/friends you have (CSV)
* I'm adding things all the time, but this list is a good sample of features

# What I Learned
* The basics of working with .csv files in python
* Simple error handling
* I became familiar with tweepy's capabilities
* Twitter's rate limits are super annoying Â 

# How To Use
* Visit https://developer.twitter.com/ and create a twitter app
* Copy and paste your twitter api keys in the keys-template.csv file. Alternatively you can pass them in as arguments using the from_args method.
* Open test.py and begin writing your code.
